# Stratagem
A singleplayer real time strategy game where you fight evil robots

## How it works
Games are played against a computer-controlled opponent. Each player controls their own forces including where they move to, when they can attack, and who they attack. Forces are made up of unmanned, metalic robots who follow the players orders exactly and instantaneously.

### Troops

#### Recon Specialist (Scout Unit)
These troops are equipped with enhanced sensory equipment and excellent mobility capabilities allowing them to swiftly execute lightweight tasks such as gathering information about your opponent's position or using them to gang up on a small target with their poor weaponry.

### Slashers (Anti-Tank Unit)
These troops are equipped with durable blades and short-range cannons. Both of these weapons has the potential to deal considerable damage to tank-type troops. However, due to their armaments and need-for-mobility, Slashers posses light armor.

### Panzer (Tank-Type Unit)
These troops are equipped a deadly, medium-range cannon and rapid-firing weaponry. Panzers are also built with heavy armor; however, they suffer from a lack of mobility due to their weight
